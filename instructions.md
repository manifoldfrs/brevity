# Instructions

You are my Pair Programmer. I want to show off my front-end skills by building an LLM project that summarizes content like books, transcripts, long articles, and/or documents and provides concise summaries, highlighting key points and takeaways.

## Initial Setup

1. Use Convex for the backend and to manage state

2. Use FastHTML for the front-end

3. Use Llama 3.1b or 3.2b for the LLM

4. I want to design the front-end with a focus a design focused on discovery. Similar to Perplexity's marketing and brand posters. Here's some more information about Perplexity's design, please use it to recommend good CSS styles and design patterns themed around discovery:

Perplexity's design team has received significant recognition for their innovative and visually striking approach to branding and marketing. While I don't have specific information about individual product managers, I can share some key details about Perplexity's design leadership and approach:

## Design Leadership

**Henry Modisett** serves as Perplexity's head of design[1]. As a founding designer, he played a crucial role in shaping the product's user experience and visual identity. Before joining Perplexity, Henry worked at Google and Quora, giving him valuable experience in information-seeking products[1].

## Brand and Marketing Design

The marketing art you've noticed has indeed garnered attention for its unique aesthetic. Some key points about Perplexity's brand design:

1. **Visual Identity**: The company worked with design agency Smith & Diction to develop their initial visual identity guidelines[2].

2. **Aesthetic Inspiration**: The team drew inspiration from vintage Apple ads from the 80s and 90s, aiming for a gritty, textured look that evokes emotion without being corny[2].

3. **Poster Design**: Perplexity's posters are designed to feel like artwork you could hang in your home. They use tools like Midjourney to develop these aesthetics, combining AI-generated elements with traditional graphic design techniques[2].

4. **Brand Philosophy**: The design team aims to create a brand that feels more like a journey of discovery than a tech product, leaning heavily into themes of curiosity and knowledge-seeking[2].

5. **Key Team Member**: While not specifically a product manager or UI designer, **Phi** is mentioned as an important figure in Perplexity's brand design. He has been instrumental in developing the company's visual aesthetic and merchandise strategy[2][3].

## Design Approach

Henry Modisett has shared some insights into Perplexity's design philosophy:

1. **Simplicity**: The team focuses on delivering information as quickly and reliably as possible, resulting in a relatively simple user interface[1].

2. **Consumer-Friendly**: Unlike some AI tools that require complex prompts, Perplexity is designed to work well with simple keyword searches, making it more accessible to average users[1].

3. **Design System**: Henry started by building a component system in React as his first step, giving the team a flexible toolbox for rapidly developing new features[3].

4. **Dynamic Interfaces**: The team designs for dynamic content, creating abstracted UI systems that can adapt to various use cases[3].

While I don't have specific information about current product managers or UI designers beyond what's mentioned above, it's clear that Perplexity has invested significantly in design as a core part of their product and brand strategy.
